# Machine-Learning-Course-Project
Ensemble Learning. Regression problem.

The mini-final project of the ML course I took in the Fall of 2022. My first introduction to machine learning. This project is aimed to predict car prices based on its features. The data was found in free repositories. After further development, the project can be transformed into a tool that can be used by drivers to evaluate their cars and their current prices on the market.
